## 🙋‍♂️ About Me

I am 28 years old, I have extensive experience in 3D modeling using CAD/CAM software,
I love mathematics and physics my goal is to learn how to develop CAD/CAM/CAE software.
I am self study invidual with no degree.

## 🌱 I’m currently learning:

  - C++11/17/20,
  - DEAL.II,
  - CGAL,
  - DirectX11,HLSL,
  - Win32 API,
  - CMake

## ⚡ Fun fact:

  - Since the very beginning I was into programming, I went to operate CNC machines and I was wishing to perform programming on them but all I was doing was changing variables, I can remember I was more interested In software mathematics than in operating machines itself. 



## 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on:

  - I wish to work on 3d software but it will take long time for me to learn.
