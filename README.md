# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## I am 28 years old, I have extensive experience in 3D modeling using CAD/CAM software,
### I love mathematics and physics after long break caused by health problems I am going back to learn how to develop CAD/CAM/CAE software.

If you have passion for 3D and you can share knowledge, I am open for contact, you can reach me throught ![LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kjfreelancing/)

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on DirectX11 application I wish to create simple 3D CAD.  https://github.com/oBornToCreateo/JCAD2

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
  - C++11/17/20,
  - HLSL,
  - DirectX11,
  - Win32 API,
  - CMake

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate mostly on 3D Software:
  - Games,
  - CAD software,
  - Embedded Solutions


- âš¡ Fun fact:
  - Since the very beginning I was into programming, I went to operate CNC machines and I was wishing to perform programming on them but all I was doing was changing variables, I can remember I was more interested In software mathematics than in operating machines itself.
